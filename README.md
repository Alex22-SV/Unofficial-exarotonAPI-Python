# About
The idea of this repository is to help you use the exaroton API with Python. **THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL**

# Steps
1. Download the code
2. Install the dependecy `aiohttp` (run the command `pip install aiohttp` in the terminal of the path of the downloaded folder)
3. Run the exaroton.py file
4. Complete the survey with your exaroton information and press Enter
5. You should now get the information you requested.
